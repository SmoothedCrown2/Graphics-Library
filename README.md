# Graphics-Library
Simple graphics library written in C for Linux OS

Warning: you must be able to run this on a linux-based operating system environment

This graphics library has 8 main functionalities that enable the user to initialize and manipulate graphics <br />
The library allows for text to be drawn, individual pixel manipulation, drawing rectangles, drawing circles, and clearing the graphics <br />
Additionally, there is functionality for initializing graphics, cleaning up graphics after use, and putting the program to sleep for fractions of a second between drawing to the screen

I have also provided a demo of how to utilize the library in game.c <br />
In this game, the user is able to move a player around the screen and collect coins
